# Nvim-Config

A fine place to store my nvim configurations.

## Note

* **Make sure to run ./install.sh after each update to any config file!**

* Config branches are possible by simply creating git branches. Again, **run ./install.sh after each update!**

* You may find the history of this repo a little weird. \
That's because it was detached (at commit `dfe7abb85e1c1e5f8a5b57a60134c4a14c4a82f0`) from my dotfiles repo.
